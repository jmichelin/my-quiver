Unlike other tower defense games, you must position your towers using CSS! \nWe'll start with container properties. A flexbox container has a main axis and a cross axis. \nflexbox diagram Use the justify-content property on the tower group container to move your towers into effective positions. \njustify-content positions a container's items along the main axis and accepts the following values: \nflex-start: group items at the start of a container's main axis \nflex-end: group items at the end of the main axis \ncenter: group items in the center of the main axis \nspace-between: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that the first item aligns at the start and the final item aligns at the end \nspace-around: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that all items have equal space around them \nTry justify-content: center;\n for example, to move the container's towers to the center of the main axis."
