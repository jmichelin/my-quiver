If you have a component that will never update (like a static logo or something) you can just return false here. Normally React is really fast at doing this diffs anyway so it's a good idea to only put in a shouldComponentUpdate method if it's actually a performance issue. Typically in the method body you would check the bare minimum of state that needs to have changed to warrant a re-render. We'll discuss this more in depth later."
