Here, therefore, is what this does:\n\nf(1): returns n, which is 1\nf(2): returns 2 * f(1), which is 2\nf(3): returns 3 * f(2), which is 6\nf(4): returns 4 * f(3), which is 24\nf(5): returns 5 * f(4), which is 120\nf(6): returns 6 * f(5), which is 720\nf(7): returns 7 * f(6), which is 5040\nf(8): returns 8 * f(7), which is 40320\nf(9): returns 9 * f(8), which is 362880\nf(10): returns 10 * f(9), which is 3628800"
