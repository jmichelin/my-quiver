The issue here is that most developers incorrectly understand the statement var a = b = 3; to be shorthand for:\n\nvar b = 3;\nvar a = b;\nBut in fact, var a = b = 3; is actually shorthand for:\n\nb = 3;\nvar a = b;\nAs a result (if you are not using strict mode), the output of the code snippet would be:\n\na defined? false\nb defined? true\nBut how can b be defined outside of the scope of the enclosing function? Well, since the statement var a = b = 3; is shorthand for the statements b = 3; and var a = b;, b ends up being a global variable (since it is not preceded by the var keyword) and is therefore still in scope even outside of the enclosing function.\n\nNote that, in strict mode (i.e., with use strict), the statement var a = b = 3; will generate a runtime error of ReferenceError: b is not defined, thereby avoiding any headfakes/bugs that might othewise result. (Yet another prime example of why you should use use strict as a matter of course in your code!)"
